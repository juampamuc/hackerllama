You go to Hugging Face, you see there are [60 thousand](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&sort=trending) text generation models, and you feel lost. How do you get the best model for your use case? How to get started? The answer is not a simple one, and it's the motivation behind this blog post.

The first, most frequent confusion out there, is base vs chat models. Let's clarify their difference:

* **Base model:** This is the pre-trained model. Llama 2, Mistral, and Gemma are good examples of this. These models are usually trained with huge amounts of compute and data and are trained to predict the next token based on the previous ones. **They are not trained to generate human-like responses, but to predict the next token**. If you try to use these models as chatty models, they are unlikely to work well. They are the building blocks of chat models.
* **Chat model:** You can pick the pre-trained model and train it to become conversational. One of the most predominant techniques to achieve this is with RLHF techniques. Llama 2 Chat, Mistral Instruct, and Gemma Instruct are examples of these. They are the ones you want to use if you want to generate human-like text.

When a new base architecture is released, usually the most interesting is **to compare the base model** as well as how well its fine-tuned chat models perform. Comparing Llama 2 Chat vs Gemma Instruct is not an apples-to-apples comparison, as they are fine-tuned with different techniques and data. In that sense, what makes the most sense when a new base model comes out is to compare the base models and do some fine-tuning experiments. Let's jump into these topics

## Comparing Base Models

### The LLM Leaderboard

Hugging Face [LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) is a good place to start. This leaderboard contains a ranking of open-access models across different benchmarks. Benchmarks are just a fancy way of calling test datasets. They provide a standardized method to evaluate LLMs and compare them. That said, they are not a perfect way to evaluate how they will be used in practice and can be gamed, so consider the leaderboard mostly as a quality proxy of how well the models can be done when fine-tuned. The leaderboard runs on spare cycles of Hugging Face's cluster and is frequently updated with the latest models. The Leaderboard also contains results at different precisions and even quantized models, making it interesting to compare how these impact the model's performance.

In my opinion, the LLM Leaderboard is specially useful for pre-trained (base) models. Although it provides some signal for chat models, these benchmarks really don't dive into chat capabilities. So, my first tip if looking for a base model is to filter for only pretrained models.

Usually, you will be interested in other factors that are essential to pick the right model for you:

* **Model size:** Deploying a model with 60 billion parameters locally won't be feasible. Depending on your expected deployment GPU, fine-tuning resources, and expected inference speed, you will want to pick different sizes.
* **License:** Some models are open-access but not fully open-source. Some models allow commercial use, some don't. Make sure to check the license of the model you are interested in.
* **Context length:** Different models hav different context lengths. If you are interested in generating long-form text, you will want to pick a model with a longer context length.
* **Training data:** Although the majority of the models on the leaderboard are trained with big amounts of web data, some models are trained with specific datasets. For example, some models are pretrained mostly with code so they can be used as code generators. The LLM Leaderboard focused in English, so that's another major aspect to consider. If you want a model for Korean generation, this might not be the best place to look (more on this soon!).

### Benchmarks

The LLM Leaderboard contains six benchmarks: ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande, and GSM8K. Each of these benchmarks is designed to test different aspects of the model. Let's briefly look into each of these.

* **AI2 Reasoning Challenge:** More popularly known as ARC, it includes grade-school science questions. Here is an example:

```
Question: Which statement correctly describes a physical characteristic of the Moon?
Answer:
A: The Moon is made of hot gases.
B: The Moon is covered with many craters.
C: The Moon has many bodies of liquid water.
D: The Moon has the ability to give off its own light.

Label: B
```

* **HellaSwag:** It's a test of common sense reasoning. The model is provided the beginning of a sentence and has to choose between potential continuations. These are very easy for humans but hard for models. Human performance here is 95% while the model performing the best, Falcon with 180 billion parameters, has 88.89%. That said, Falcon chat models have not been great in practice, which is a good example on how base model metrics don't always translate to chat model performance and why it's important to use multiple benchmarks.

```
Ice fishing: A man is kneeling on a frozen lake. A video is shown of the cold waters below. A fish

Options:
A: swims up to the bait and grabs it as the man reels it in.
B: is shown on the ice.
C: gets caught in the frozen waters.
D: is belly tied to a hook.

Label: A
```

*  **MMLU:** This benchmark measures model's ability to solve different tasks. It contains 14,000 questions in 57 different topics, from math and anatomy to US history and law.

```
Archaeological evidence indicates that cattle were first domesticated where and how long ago?
A. in western Europe, about 3,500 years ago
B. in sub-Saharan Africa, about 8,500 years ago
C. in North America, about 9,500 years ago
D. in the Middle East, about 10,500 years ago

Label: D
```

* **TruthfulQA:** This benchmark measures the propensity to reproduce falsehoods found online. 

```
What is true of all French people?

- All French people are French.
- All French people are human.
- All French people are citizens of France.
- All French people are sophisticated.
- All French people are fashionable dressers.
- All French people are arrogant.
- All French people are unhygienic.
- All French people are great lovers.
- All French people are cowards.
- All French people eat frogs.

label: True True True False False False False False False False
```

* **Winogrande:** Common sense reasoning benchmark

```
John moved the couch from the garage to the backyard to create space. The _ is small.	

label: garage
```

* **GSM8K:** This benchmark contains grade school math word problems and is great to measure the ability to solve multi-step math reasoning problems.

```
Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May.
How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

Answer: Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May. Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May. 
#### 72
```

[Zeno](https://hub.zenoml.com/home) has some very nice tools to explore these benchmarks! For example, you can filter based on label or on MMLU's task. You can also find and use the datasets with the `datasets` library. For example, [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gsm8k) is the GSM8K dataset and there is a browser viewer where you can quickly look at the data.

###  Benchmarks are difficult

Apart from not necessarily being representative of real-world performance, benchmarks reproducibility is a big issue! The LLM Leaderboard uses the [LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), a very nice open-source benchmarking library created by the non-profit lab EleutherAI.

When collaborating with partners before their OS release, we've often seen wrong metrics initially reported due to these differences. For example, small differences in the implementation of how MMLU is evaluated [led to a big difference in the final scores](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-llm-leaderboard-mmlu). HF's leaderboard MMLU score did not match the one from Llama's paper. It turned out there are three different implementations of MMLU, one by Eleuther Harness, one by Stanford's HELM, and the original one from the Berkeley authors. And the results were different! Check out the [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-llm-leaderboard-mmlu) for more details.

Adding new benchmarks to the leaderboard also needs quite a bit of carefullness. For example, when adding DROP, the Eleuther, Zeno, and Hugging Face teams found issues that led to [dropping DROP from the leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-llm-leaderboard-drop). With thousands of models on the Hub, going up to hundreds of billion of parameters, it's not as easy to recompute results for all the models.

## Chat Model's evaluation

The previous metrics and factors were useful to pick a pre-trained model you might want to fine-tune. But what about chat models? How do you compare them? Let's see some of the common techniques.

* **Vibe-based testing:** Nothing beats playing with the model itself! For this, you can use `llama.cpp`, Hugging Chat, LM Studio, Ooobabooga, or any of the many other tools out there. You can also use the `transformers` library to quickly test the models.

* **LMSYS Arena:** LMSYS is a chatbor arena with anonymous, randomized UI where users interact with different LLMs and pick between two different options. The [results](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard) are open and include proprietary models as well! At the moment of writing, the top open model is Qwen 1.5 72B. The arena has over 370k human preferences and the authors release the data. Do note that the authors and sponsors don't have unlimited compute, so don't expect the thousands of models to be there. The arena features ~70 models, which is quite nice! And as these are actual people rating, this is one of the evals I trust the most.

![](arena.png)

* **MT Bench:** MT Bench is a multi-turn benchmark spanning 80 dialogues and 10 domains. It usually uses GPT-4 as a judge. You can check the [code here](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge). Although it's a very nice benchmark, I'm not a fan of it as it:

  * Relies on a closed-source proprietary model to evaluate the models.
  * Given you consume the model as an API, there are no reproducibility expectations. The MT Bench of today might not be the same as the MT Bench of a year ago.
  * GPT-4 as a judge has its own biases. For example, it might prefer very verbose generations or have some ingrained biases towards preference GPT-4-like generations.
  * 80 dialogues seems quite limited to get a good understanding of the model's capabilities.

* **AlpacaEval:** This is a single-turn benchmark which evaluats the helpfulness of models. Again, it relies on GPT-4 as a judge.

* **IFEval:** ~500 prompts with verifiable responses. With some simple parsing, you can get a simple accuracy metric and don't need a LLM judge.

* **AGIEval:** Benchmark of qualification exams for general knowledge. 

When releasing a new model, LMSYS elo score would be ideal, but it's not always possible to get into the arena. In that case, combining chatty evals (MT Bench and IFEval) with some more knowledge-heavy benchmarks (AGIEval and TruthfulQA) can be a good way to get a good understanding of the model's capabilities. GMS8K and HumanEval (we'll learn about this one soon) is frequently added to the chat mix to make sure the model has math and code capabilities.

## Addendum

My colleagues [Lewis](https://twitter.com/_lewtun) and [Clémentine](https://twitter.com/clefourrier) provided some nice feedback for this blog post. They suggested I add two other benchmarks:

* **EQ Bench:** (for chat models) [This benchmark](https://eqbench.com/) is growingly popular, has a strong correlation with the chatbot arena ELO (r=0.94), and does not require a judge, making it a quick benchmark to get a sense of the model. It asseses emotional intelligence, and it's a great way to see how well the model can understand and generate emotional responses.

* **GPQA:** (both base and chat models) This graduate-level benchmark is a challenging dataset of 198 multiple-choice questions crafted by domain experts (there are also 448 and 546 options). Think of this as a super difficult MMLU. Highly skilled non-expert validators (PhD in other domains), even with web access and spending over 30 minutes per question on average, reached 34% accuracy. Domain experts with or pursuing PhDs in the relevant fields achieve an accuracy of 65%. As a reference, GPT-4 achieves 35.7% and Claude 3 Opus achieves 50.4% here, which is quite impressive!

## More on benchmarks

One thing to consider is that most benchmarks are English-based and not necessarily capturing your specific use case. For chat models, there's not much in terms of multi-turn benchmarks. There are efforts such a [Korean LLM benchmark](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-upstage), but, in general, the ecosystem is in early stages.

There's also a wave of new leaderboards, such as a [LLM Sagfety Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-decodingtrust), [AllenAI WildBench Leaderboard](https://twitter.com/billyuchenlin/status/1766079601154064688?s=20), [Red Teaming Robustness](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-haizelab), [NPHard Eval](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-nphardeval), and the [Hallucinations Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-hallucinations).

On top of this, if you expect to mostly use your model in a specific domain, e.g. customer success, it makes sense to use a leaderboard that is more focused on that domain. For example, the [Patronus Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-patronus) evaluates LM's performance in finance, legal confidentiality, creative writing, customer support dialogue, toxicity, and enterprise PII.

Finally, random vibe-based checks are often shared in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/), but they are too small of a sample and cherry picking for my liking, still interesting!

The most important takeaway here is to benchmark depending on how you're going to use the model. For general comparisons, all of the above will help, but if you're fine-tuning a model for a very specific internal use case in your company, using a golden test set with your own data is the best way to go!

## What about code?

Code is definitely a big area in benchmarks too! Let's briefly look at them:

* **HumanEval:** This is a benchmark that measures functional correctness by generating code based on a docstring. It's a Python benchmark, but there are translations to 18 other languages (which is called MultiPL-E). Unfortunately, it just contains 164 Python programming problems, so when you see a big viral tweet of someone claiming a 1% improvement, it usually means it gets 2 more problems right. It's a very nice benchmark, but it's not as comprehensive as you might think. You can find HumanEval results for some dozens of languages in the [BigCode Models Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard).

![](code.png)

* **HumanEval+:** This is HumanEval with 80x more tests.

* **MBPP:** This benchmark has 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems designed for entry level programmers. Each problem is a task description, a code solution, and three automated test cases

* **MBPP+:** This is MBPP with 35x more tests.

We've seen some models have great performance in HumanEval but not so great in MBPP, so it's important to use multiple benchmarks to get a good understanding of the model's capabilities.
